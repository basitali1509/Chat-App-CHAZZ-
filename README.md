# CHAZZ - Chatting App

Chatting Application

# About App
A chatting application using Flutter and Firebase.
This app is designed to allow multiple users to sign in and engage in real time conversations with each other.
A user can search for any existing account and initiate chats by simply using the account holder's email address.

In order to ensure security and privacy of users, I have implemented Firebase Authentication for login, sign up and login with phone number functionalities. 
Additionally, I have included a password recovery feature in case the user forgets their password.

All chats within the app are saved in Firestore, which allows easy retrieval and viewing of past conversations.
